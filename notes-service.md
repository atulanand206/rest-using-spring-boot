# Notes Service

We have all the necessary utility infrastructure ready and we can start creating a new service now. We'll be using a different technique for development now. 

As we've seen the end goal of a spring boot service which has following components.

1. The tests are written for the controller.
2. Validations are written in the domain service.
3. Stored procedures are used for database calls.

Let's create a new package which would host the test class.
