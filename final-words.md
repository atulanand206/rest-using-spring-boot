# Final Words

All of the source code can be found at [https://github.com/atulanand206/rest-using-spring-boot](https://github.com/atulanand206/rest-using-spring-boot). 

We have successfully developed an authentication system in the test driven fashion. We saw how to switch data sources and communicate with the external world. This service can act as a micro-service for any other service which requires users. 

Looking forward to implementing this in one or more services in future.
