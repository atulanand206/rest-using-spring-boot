# Introduction

This is a guide to develop a server side application using Spring boot and tested using JUnit.

For the purposes of this project, we would be developing a Spring Boot service with following requirements:

1. A set of users with certain privileges and restrictions. 
2. A user can only read and write own profile.
3. There will be different types of users who would have access to the information with read and write permissions.

The implementation would be done in a Test Driven fashion to never take on huge responsibility and keep delivering software in small increments. The test and production code would be refactored several times and it may feel useless at times but in the end, it will all lead to a robust system and after all that's what every stakeholder wants.
